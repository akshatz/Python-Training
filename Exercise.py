# Question 1:

# Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:

# Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]

# Following are the fixed values of C and H:

# C is 50. H is 30.

# D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.

# Example

# Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:

# 100,150,180

# The output of the program should be:

# 18,22,24

# Hints:

# If the output received is in decimal form, it should be rounded off to its nearest value (for example, if the output received is 26.0, it should be printed as 26)

# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input. 


# Question 2:

# Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.

# Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1.

# Example

# Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:

# 3,5

# Then, the output of the program should be:

# [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]] 


# Hints:

# Note: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input in a comma-separated form.


# Question 3:

# Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

# without,hello,bag,world

# Then, the output should be:

# bag,hello,without,world


# Hints:

# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.


# Question 4:

# Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.

# Example:

# 0100,0011,1010,1001

# Then the output should be:

# 1010

# Notes: Assume the data is input by console.


# Hints:

# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.



# Question 5:

# Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.

# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

# hello world! 123

# Then, the output should be:

# LETTERS 10

# DIGITS 3


# Hints:

# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.


# Question 6:

# Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

# Hello world!

# Then, the output should be:

# UPPER CASE 1

# LOWER CASE 9


# Hints:

# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Question 7:

# A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.

# Following are the criteria for checking the password:

# 1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]

# 2. At least 1 number between [0-9]

# 1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]

# 3. At least 1 character from [$#@]

# 4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6

# 5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12

# Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.

# Example

# If the following passwords are given as input to the program:

# ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345

# Then, the output of the program should be:

# ABd1234@1


# Hints:

# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

# Question 8:

# Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.
